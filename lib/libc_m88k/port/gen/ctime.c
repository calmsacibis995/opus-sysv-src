/*
 * This routine converts time as follows.
 * The epoch is 0000 Jan 1 1970 GMT.
 * The argument time is in seconds since then.
 * The localtime(t) entry returns a pointer to an array
 * containing
 *  seconds (0-59)
 *  minutes (0-59)
 *  hours (0-23)
 *  day of month (1-31)
 *  month (0-11)
 *  year-1970
 *  weekday (0-6, Sun is 0)
 *  day of the year
 *  daylight savings flag
 *
 * The routine corrects for daylight saving
 * time and will work in any time zone provided
 * "timezone" is adjusted to the difference between
 * Greenwich and local standard time (measured in seconds).
 * In places like Michigan "daylight" must
 * be initialized to 0 to prevent the conversion
 * to daylight time.
 * There is a table which accounts for the peculiarities
 * undergone by daylight time in 1974-1975.
 *
 * The routine does not work
 * in Saudi Arabia which runs on Solar time.
 *
 * _asctime(tvec)
 * where tvec is produced by localtime
 * returns a ptr to a character string
 * that has the ascii time in the form
 *	Thu Jan 01 00:00:00 1970\n\0
 *	01234567890123456789012345
 *	0	  1	    2
 *
 * _ctime(t) just calls localtime, then _asctime.
 *
 * tzset() looks for an environment variable named
 * TZ. 
 * If the variable is present, it will set the external
 * variables "timezone", "_altzone", "daylight", and "tzname"
 * appropriately. It is called by localtime, and
 * may also be called explicitly by the user.
