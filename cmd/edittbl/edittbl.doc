NAME
	edittbl - edit the opus configuration file
SYNOPSIS
	/etc/edittbl [file]
DESCRIPTION
	edittbl is an administator utility that permits changes to the
	DOS-level configuration file, "\opus\opus.cfg". This file is
	read by the DOS program opmon(1) when it runs a standalone
	program or boots unix. Edittbl is used to change the opmon
	driver configuration after the initial installation. After
	using edittbl, "mkopmon" is normally run to build a new "opmon"
	with the devices listed in the new configuration file. The unix
	system must then be shut down and rebooted with the new opmon
	to enable the new device configuration.

	Edittbl is a menu driver program. The following list describes
	the various options available:

		- Add a driver : This submenu lists all the possible
				 groups of drivers. Once you select
				 a group, you will be prompted for the
				 specific driver type, name, and options.

		- Delete a driver : remove one or more drivers from the
				 configuration file.

		- Quit the program, saving the new configuration in
				 the DOS file "\opus\opus.cfg".

		- Exit the program without making any changes to the
				 original configuration file.

	The "file" argument allows you to specify a DOS configuration
	filename other than the default, "\opus\opus.cfg".
