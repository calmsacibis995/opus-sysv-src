MONDEV.c(4)		(Opus)				MONDEV.C(4)

NAME
	mondev.c - "edittbl" device driver database for "opmon"

DESCRIPTION
	Mondev.c is the data base for all valid device drivers
	in "opmon". This file is also part of the "opmon" driver kit.
	"Edittbl" checks the "mondev.c" file for valid and non-duplicate
	entries when modifying the system configuration table, "opus.cfg".
	
Format for edittbl-compatible mondev.c:
Example entry:
	/** BIOS disk*:<dsk/?> */
		{ "c:", &dt_c10 },
		{ "d:", &dt_d10 },

Description:
	Each device type is enclosed in "/**     */". The double star
	at the start of the comment tells "edittbl" that this is a
	device name.

	Each device name has two parts seperated with a colon. The
	left side of the colon is the descriptive name of the device.
	If the name ends in a star"*", is means this is a required
	device. The right side of the colon is the "opus.cfg" unix
	name, i.e., the name on the left side of the equal sign in
	an "opus.cfg" file device entry. If this name ends with a
	question mark, then the device may have multiple entries with
	a sequence number in place of the "?". In the example above,
	the first BIOS disk is called "dsk/0", the second one is
	"dsk/1", etc.

	The dos devices are assumed to be all consecutive lines after
	the device name. The "edittbl" script displays the 1st field
	as the dos device name and checks that no two selected entries
	have the same function name (the 2nd field starting with "&").
	"Edittbl" stops parsing new lines as devices when it reaches
	a blank line.

	"Edittbl" will only display the first device when the are
	multiple devices on a line. This is can be used to hide entries
	and display only one of the three devices for each tty device.
