@(#)README	1.2	1/16/85	(jima)

Liblang presently contains chipbug.o, which will be loaded with most
language tools and the kernel.

I called it "liblang" because chipbug is mostly language tool related,
and there is at least one other shared module in the language tools
which could go here (currently the source is duplicated).

chipbug.h is in usr/include.
