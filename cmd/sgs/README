This tape contains the m78k software generation system files.  It is loaded
by:
		cpio -iBcvdamu </dev/TAPE.CART

To load the whole tape requires about 8000 blocks of disk space.  If you
will not need the include files, the "INCLUDE" directory can be removed,
saving about 2000 blocks.

The tape contains the following directories and files:
	
	bin:	m78kcc		SEE NOTE BELOW re: THIS SCRIPT!
		m78kas		SEE NOTE BELOW re: THIS SCRIPT!
		m78kar m78kcoffcmp m78kcoffdump m78kcomp
		m78kconvert m78kcprs m78kdump m78kld m78klorder
		m78knm m78ksim m78ksize m78kstrip sifilter

	lib:	ghsstubs.s m78kas m78kcc m78kcomp m78kcpp
		m78kcrt0.o m78klibc.a m78klibcrypt.a m78klibcurses.
		m78klibgen.a m78klibm.a m78klibns.a m78klibnsl_s.a
		m78kreorder motstubs.s

	gh7bin: m78kcc		SEE NOTE BELOW re: THIS SCRIPT!

	gh7lib: m78kcomp
		m78kcrt0.o m78klibc.a m78klibm.a

	INCLUDE:	contains /usr/include and /usr/include/sys
			files for m78k compilations

                                 NOTES

Once the tape has been loaded, it is necessary to modify the "m78kcc"
scripts in the "bin" and "gh7bin" directories.  The first line of
each of these files sets the environment variable $TOOLDIR, which should
point to the directory into which the tape was loaded.  For example, if
the tape was loaded into /XENV, so that you created directories
/XENV/bin, /XENV/gh7bin, and so forth, then the first line should read:

	TOOLDIR=/XENV

It is also necessary to modify the "m78kas" script in the "bin"
directory.  As described above, the first line of this file must
point to the TOOLS directory on your system.

Those working on the kernel need to add the "-k" option to the
"sifilter" call in bin/m78kas.

                            REVISION LIST:

1 1/20/88	built with /bin/cc
2 1/20/88	SAJ fixes to tables.c and stubs.s
3 1/22/88	FNF fixes to as/m78k/program.c, comp(.fix)/src/code.c
4 1/22/88	PEG additions to sim/ctl/cmdstruct.c and integer/sysV.c
			to support additional system calls
5 1/26/88	contains libraries built with compiler fixes from #3
6 1/28/88	PEG fix to simulator - getdents system call
		FNF fixes to comp.fix and ld
		SAJ modification to stubs.s
7 2/2/88	PEG fixes to simulator: sysV.c, trap.c, interface.c, etc.
		SiFIX libc.a generated
8 2/8/88	directories reorganized for new compiler setup
		many fixes to m78kcomp, from Austin / SAJ
		libraries built with current compiler
		no more "SiFIX" compiler / libraries; instead, assembler
			code from "m78kcomp" is passed through "sifilter"
			before being given to "m78kas".
		new set of /INCLUDE/sys/.... files from kernel group
		green hills m78k compiler included
		-z option turned on for compiler (word alignment)
9 2/11/88	simulator fixes put in so it works with stuff compiled with
		-z option:	default (currently) -z
			-z: char strings NOT word aligned (same as comp -z)
			-Z: char strings ARE word aligned
		pg_getpfn stuff added to libc.a as functions
		libld.a added to library files
		simulator fix to make ioctl system call work - PEG
		simulator fix to make getdents word alignment right - PEG
		GH m78kcrt0.o added to tape (does not inc. following fix)
		fix to m78kcrt0.o - Dale Farnsworth
10 2/12/88	sifilter fix to put in no-ops after loads and stores
		NOTE: sifilter now has a -k flag which needs to be turned
			_on_ for kernel group, left _off_ for utilities
		sifilter is now executed as part of the assembler pass,
			rather than the compiler pass.  This way, .s files
			also get "fixed".  CAW  2/12/88
11 2/18/88	compiler fixes from SAJ to common.h order.c pftn.c local2.c
		sifilter fixes from SAJ to sifilter.c
12 3/4/88	compiler fixes: allo.c, table.c (SAJ, FNF)
		cpp fixes: cpp.c (FNF)
		coffdump fixes: dump,c, filehdr.c, reloc.c, scnhdr.c, syms.c
		as fixes: gendefs.h, program.c (FNF)
		sim fixes: sysV.c (FNF)
		ld fixes: errors.c, globals.c, main.c, utils.c (FNF)
		ld now linked with -malloc -should run faster
		new Green Hills compiler binary
		latest "sys" include files; changes to ./bpp.h ./ci_driver.h
			./dk.h ./fs/s5filsys.h ./io.h ./io/esdi.h
			./io/m323io.h ./io/ramdio.h ./mvmecpu.h
			./osi/ci_const.h ./osi/ci_global.h ./space.h
			./space/m323space.h
