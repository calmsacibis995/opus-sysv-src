The following information was taken from <reloc.h>, and describes the
current supported COFF relocation types in the AT&T release, as of System V
Release 3.  There is no information about how to "official register"
a new relocation type.

	Value	Symbol		Meaning
	-----	--------	-------------------------------------
	000	R_ABS		Relocation already done, ignored.
	001	R_DIR16		B16/X86 generic, 16-bit direct reference
	002	R_REL16		B16/X86 generic, 16-bit relative reference
	003	R_IND16		B16/X86 generic, 16-bit indirect (TV) reference
	004	R_DIR24		3B generic, 24-bit direct reference
	005	R_REL24		3B generic, 24-bit relative reference
	006	R_DIR32		3B/M32 generic, 32-bit direct reference
	007	R_OFF8		X86 generic, 8-bit offset reference in 8-bits
	010	R_OFF16		X86 generic, 8-bit offset reference in 16-bits
	011	R_SEG12		X86 generic, 12-bit segment reference
	012	R_DIR32S	M32 generic, 32-bit direct reference (swapped)
	013	R_AUX		X86 generic, Auxiliary relocation entry
	014	R_OPT16		3B generic, 16-bit optimized indirect TV ref.
	015	R_IND24		3B generic, 24-bit indirect TV reference
	016	R_IND32		3B generic, 32-bit indirect TV reference
	017	R_RELBYTE	DEC/M68K/M88K, direct byte reference
	020	R_RELWORD	DEC/M68K/M88K, direct word reference
	021	R_RELLONG	DEC/M68K/M88K, direct long word reference
	022	R_PCRBYTE	DEC/M68K/M88K, pc relative byte reference
	023	R_PCRWORD	DEC/M68K/M88K, pc relative word reference
	024	R_PCRLONG	DEC/M68K/M88K, pc relative long word refer.


The following new relocation types were added to support the m88000
processor.  The numeric values were chosen to be large enough to not
conflict with any officially supported values added by AT&T.

	100	R_PCR26		M88K pc relative, lower 26 bits of 32 bit word
	101	R_HRELWORD	M88K, direct ref, relocate lower 16 bits of
				32 bit word with upper 16 bits of 32 bit addr
	102	R_HPCRWORD	M88K, pc relative, relocate lower 16 bits of
				32 bit word with upper 16 bits of 32 bit addr
