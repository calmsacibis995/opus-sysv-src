(1)	Remove intermediate file code (or make it optional) and pass
	everything in memory.  Should speed it up...

(2)	Make it totally FLEXNAMES internally, and only map to dual
	string handling when writing out COFF file.  I.E., put all
	symbols in internal string table regardless of length, and
	remove internal code that looks in two places.
