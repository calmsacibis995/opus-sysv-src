NOTES ON NEW DUCP/UDCP				JKL  5/21/86

I have generated new versions of the ducp(1*) and udcp(1*) commands
that accept wildcard file names for the source files.

Install the accompanying diskette with:

	cd /
	cpio -civBdum </dev/rflpa
	dos copy a:opmon.exe \opus
	(reboot with new opmon)

The affected files are:		/opus/bin/ducp		/opus/bin/udcp
				/opus/bin/opdos		\opus\opmon.exe

Also affected, but not included here are:
	/usr/lib/libopus.a	 /usr/include/sys/doscomm.h
	/usr/src/cmd/dos/opdos.c /usr/src/cmd/dos/doslib.c

Usage:
	ducp [-a] [-b] list_of_dos_files unix_directory
	ducp [-a] [-b] dos_file unix_file
	ducp [-a] [-b] dos_file		{ to standard output }

	udcp [-a] [-b] list_of_unix_files dos_directory
	udcp [-a] [-b] unix_file dos_file

OPTIONS: -a specifies DOS/UNIX ascii conversion.
	 -b specifies no conversion (binary; default).

DOS WILDCARD expansion is done by standard DOS functions, subject to
the usual DOS conventions.  Either / or \ can be used for directory
separators; the wildcard characters can appear only in the file name,
not in a directory name.

QUOTES:  If list_of_dos_files contains elements with special characters
(dos allows \, * and ?), the elements must be individually protected
from the unix shell by quotes:

	ducp -a "\opus\*.cfg" /tmp
	ducp -a "\opus\*.cfg" "\opus\*.bat" .

	NOT ducp -a "\opus\*.cfg \opus\*.bat" /tmp

ALSO:  Leading colons are stripped from the dos path, and dos accepts
slashes as will as backslashes.  Therefore, unless your unix file system
has very strange names, the following will work:

	ducp -a :/opus/*.* /tmp
	ducp -a c:/opus/*.* /tmp

because the shell will not expand :/opus/*.* and c:/opus/*.*
if there are no local matches.

CASE:  dos is not case-sensitive.  When using ducp, if the pattern
supplied as the dos path has no lowercase characters and has at least
one uppercase character, the unix filename is made uppercase; otherwise
the unix filename is made lowercase.
